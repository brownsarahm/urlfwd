# Example Deployment


I use this for my domain `drsmb.co` with a github organization [`drsmb-co`](https://github/drsmb-co). 

So I set that orgaization's default pages repo <https://github/drsmb-co/drsmb-co.github.io> to have my links.yml file and added the actions there. 

I [configured the domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) to the repo so that it would use `drsmb.co` if I had not purchased and configured, then the urls would be like: `drsmb-co.github.io` instead.
